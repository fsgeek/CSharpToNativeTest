\chapter{Global Naming}
\label{ch:global}

The third contribution that I propose for my thesis is to identify,
implement, and evaluate naming at global level. Unlike the work proposed in
\autoref{ch:local} and \autoref{ch:organization}, this work will explore on
considering naming as a top-level service that might provide ``Naming as a
Service''. Thus, this proposed work is an amplification of the prior work to
consider how \system can be effectively implemented at scale.
