\chapter{Local Naming}
\label{ch:local}

The first contribution that I propose for my thesis is to identify,
implement, and evaluate a system in which naming and storage are distinctly
separated.  This system will be consistent with the underlying goals and basic
architecture of \autoref{ch:model} but focus on a small-scale system: that of a
pair of devices belonging to a single individual.  I call this the ``local''
model.

By focusing on the modest scale of a single individual, I will focus on
answering key issues that are fundamental to \system.  I propose answering the
following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is necessary to implement the rich namespace model of \system
          while efficiently supporting legacy applications?
    \item How can existing applications utilize the cross-silo naming model of
          \system without being modified?
    \item How effective is \system when used within this local context?
\end{enumerate}

Despite the modest scale, this work will require implementing at least basic
versions of most of the components described in
\autoref{ch:model:sec:architecture}, which will lay the groundwork for other
elements of this thesis.
