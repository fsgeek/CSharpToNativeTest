\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We demonstrated providing useful ways to navigate/search across storage silos is not simply an HCI problem: it requires new system support. 
We proposed Nirvana that, at its heart, separates location names from context/semantic names, and maintains those names in a cross-silo
name service separate but complementary from the storage. We presented research questions to address when building Nirvana.
