abstract = {The rapid development of mobile technologies has facilitated users to generate and store files on mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. However, it has become a challenging issue for users to efficiently and effectively search for files of interest in a mobile environment involving a large number of mobile nodes. This paper presents SemFARM framework which facilitates users to publish, annotate and retrieve files which are geographically distributed in a mobile network enabled by Bluetooth. The SemFARM framework is built on semantic web technologies in support of file retrieval on low-end mobile devices. A generic ontology is developed which defines a number of keywords, their possible domains and properties. Based on semantic reasoning, similarity degrees are computed to match user queries with published file descriptions. The SemFARM prototype is implemented using the Java mobile platform (J2ME). The performance of SemFARM is evaluated from a number of aspects in comparison with traditional mobile file systems and enhanced alternatives. Experimental results are encouraging showing the effectiveness of SemFARM in file retrieval. We can conclude that the use of semantic web technologies have facilitated file retrieval in mobile computing environments maximizing user satisfaction in searching for files of interest.},

In fact, explaining all the complexity of semantic annotation systems to laymen can sometime be difficult. We believe that this communication can be simplified by providing a meaningful abstraction of the state of the art in semantic annotation models and thus, in this article, we describe the issue of semantic annotation and review a number of research and end-user tools in the field. Doing so, we provide a clear classification scheme of the features of annotation systems. We then show how this scheme can be used to clarify requirements of end-user use cases and thus simplify the communication between semantic annotation experts and the actual users of this technology.},

@article{Eck2011,
abstract = {A mechatronic system is a synergistic integration of mechanical, electrical, electronic and software technologies into electromechanical systems. Unfortunately, mechanical, electrical, and software data are often handled in separate Product Data Management (PDM) systems with no automated sharing of data between them or links between their data. Presently, this is a significant drawback with regard to supporting the collaborative and integrated design of mechatronic systems. One underlying research question to be addressed is: "How can such domain-specific PDM systems be integrated and what are the standards needed for this?" Our starting point for addressing this question is to look into how engineering data is stored today. We believe that the more intelligent and sophisticated the mechanisms for file management are, the more Computer-aided Engineering systems will benefit from them in terms of making integrated cross-disciplinary product development more efficient. However, while Computer-Aided Design and Engineering (CAD/CAE) systems and related tools such as, for example, Product Data Management (PDM), Engineering Data Management (EDM), etc. have significantly matured over the past ten years, most of their associated database systems are still based on traditional file systems and hierarchical directory structures. In light of this context, we will initially discuss a number of disadvantages of current file management systems. In the body of the paper our main contribution is presented. That is, a formal mathematical model of a new semantic file system, SIL (Semantics Instead of Location), that allows engineers to access data based on semantic information rather than storage location is proposed. A major difference between our approach and previous related work is that we do not aim at yet another point solution and, instead, propose an approach that may be employed by next generation engineering data processing systems on a larger scale. In addition, a corresponding programming interface along with a graphical user interface used as a file browser is presented and the benefits of utilizing the proposed semantic file system for product data management in the field of integrated design of mechatronic systems are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A new desktop interface element – the pile – was developed and prototype through an iterative process. The design in- cludes direct manipulation techniques and support for browsing, and goes beyond physical world functionality by providing system assistance for automatic pile construction and reorganization.

As users have be- gun to interact with increasing amounts of data and are increasingly demanding search capability, such a simple hierarchical model has outlasted its usefulness. For this reason, we should design file systems whose organiza- tions map to the ways we access and manipulate data now. We present a new file system architecture in which we replace the hierarchical namespace with a tagged, search-based one.},

Sedar is one of the the first archival file systems that integrates semantic storage and retrieval capabilities. In addition, Sedar introduces several novel features: the notion of “semantic-hashing” to reduce the storage consumption that is robust against misalignment of documents; “virtual snapshot” of namespace, and “con- ceptual deletions” of files and directories. It exposes a se- mantic catalog that allows other semantic-based tools (e.g., visualization and statistical analysis) to be built. It uses a decentralized peer-to-peer storage utility enabling horizon- tal scalability.},

They$\backslash$nare also a rich source of semantic metadata about$\backslash$nfiles. However, this metadata is unstructured and$\backslash$nopaque to the rest of the system. As a result, metadata$\backslash$nin file names is often error-prone, and hard to search$\backslash$nfor. File names can and should be more meaningful and$\backslash$nreliable, while simplifying application design and$\backslash$nencouraging users and applications to provide more$\backslash$nmetadata for search. We describe a POSIX compliant$\backslash$nprototype file system, TrueNames, which demonstrates an$\backslash$nalternate approach to naming and metadata, called$\backslash$nmetadata aware naming. TrueNames separates the task of$\backslash$nuniquely identifying a file from the task of helping$\backslash$nthe user remember its contents. It captures metadata in$\backslash$na structured format for later indexing, and uses it to$\backslash$ngenerate file names which are correct, regenerable, and$\backslash$ndisambiguatable by design. TrueNames simplifies$\backslash$napplication design by providing a consistent interface$\backslash$nfor metadata aware naming, incurs a low overhead of$\backslash$napproximately 15{\%} under realistic workloads, and can$\backslash$nsimplify a wide variety of data management tasks for$\backslash$nboth applications and users.},

In our approach, we build models of how journaling file systems order disk writes under different journaling modes and use these models to inject write failures during file system updates. Using our technique, we analyze if journaling file systems maintain on-disk consistency in the presence of disk write failures. We apply our technique to three important Linux journaling file systems: ext3, Reiserfs, and IBM JFS. From our analysis, we identify several design flaws and correctness bugs in these file systems, which can cause serious file system errors ranging from data corruption to unmountable file systems.},

@article{Schandl2009,

This strict adherence is kept on all levels, ranging from the identification and transportation (URI, HTTP) to the interpretation (RDF, RDFS, OWL) of resource descriptions. Because these standards are open and accessible to everybody, broad acceptance and proliferation of LOD technologies in Web-based applications and services are enabled. On typical desktops, however, the majority of applications are not aware of Web standards, but use hierarchical file systems to organize and store information. This results in a gap between the two distinct information spaces of the Web and the desktop. To bridge this gap, we propose a virtual file system representation of LOD sets, through which they can be accessed as if they were present in the file system and thus easily be used within desktop applications.},

@article{Schandl2009a,
abstract = {With the increasing storage capacity of personal computing devices, the problems of information overload and information fragmentation become apparent on users' desktops. For the Web, semantic technologies aim at solving this problem by adding a machine-interpretable information layer on top of existing resources, and it has been shown that the application of these technologies to desktop environments is helpful for end users. Certain characteristics of the Semantic Web architecture that are commonly accepted in the Web context, however, are not desirable for desktops; e.g., incomplete information, broken links, or disruption of content and annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose the sile model, an intermediate data model that combines attributes of the Semantic Web and file systems. This model is intended to be the conceptual foundation of the Semantic Desktop, and to serve as underlying infrastructure on which applications and further services, e.g., virtual file systems, can be built. In this paper, we present the sile model, discuss Semantic Web vocabularies that can be used in the context of this model to annotate desktop data, and analyze the performance of typical operations on a virtual file system implementation that is based on this model.},

@article{Min2015,
abstract = {Today, systems software is too complex to be bug-free. To find bugs in systems software, developers often rely on code checkers, like Sparse in Linux. However, the capability of existing tools used in commodity, large-scale systems is limited to finding only shallow bugs that tend to be introduced by the simple mistakes of programmers and require no deep understanding of code. Unfortunately, a majority of and difficult-to-find bugs are semantic ones, which violate high-level rules or invariants (e.g., missing a permission check). Thus, it is difficult for code-checking tools that lack the understanding of a programmer's true intention, to reason about semantic correctness. To solve this problem, we present JUXTA, a tool that au-tomatically infers high-level semantics directly from source code. The key idea of JUXTA is to compare and contrast mul-tiple existing implementations that obey latent yet implicit high-level semantics. For example, the implementation of open() at the file system layer expects to handle an out-of-space error of the disk, regardless of implementation. We have applied JUXTA to 54 file systems in the stock Linux kernel (680K LoC), found 139 previously unknown semantic bugs (one bug per 4.9K LoC), and provided corresponding patches to 41 different file systems that include mature, popu-lar file systems like ext4, btrfs, xfs and nfs. These semantic bugs are not easy to locate, as all that JUXTA found have ex-isted for over 6.4 years on average. Not only do our empirical results look promising, but the design of JUXTA is generic (not specific to file systems) enough to be easily extended to any software that has multiple implementations, like browsers or network stacks.

abstract = {We capture student interactions in an e-learning community to construct a semantic web (SW) to create a collective meta-knowledge structure guiding students as they search the existing knowledge corpus. We use formal concept analysis (FCA) as a knowledge acquisition tool to process the students virtual surfing trails to express and exploit the dependencies between web-pages to yield subsequent and more effective focused search results. We mirror social navigation and bypass the cumbersome manual annotation of webpages and at the same time paralleling social navigation for knowledge. We present our system KAPUST2 (Keeper and Processor of User Surfing Trails) which constructs from captured students trails a conceptual lattice guiding student queries. We use KAPUST as an e-learning software for an undergraduate class over two semesters. We show how the lattice evolved over the two semesters, improving its performance by exploring the relationship between 'kinds' of research assignments and the e-learning semantic web development. Course instructors monitored the evolution of the lattice with interesting positive pedagogical consequences. These are reported as well in this paper. ? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gifford1991,
abstract = { A semantic file system is an information storage system that provides flexible associative access to the system's contents by automatically extracting attributes from files with file type specific transducers. Associative access is provided by a conservative extension to existing tree-structured file system protocols, and by protocols that are designed specifically for content based access. Compatiblity with existing file system protocols is provided by introducing the concept of a virtual directory. Virtual directory names are interpreted as queries, and thus provide flexible associative access to files and directories in a manner compatible with existing software. Rapid attribute-based access to file system contents is implemented by automatic extraction and indexing of key properties of file system objects. The automatic indexing of files and directories is called "semantic" because user programmable transducers use information about the semantics of updated file system objects to extract the properties for indexing. Experimental results from a semantic file system implementation support the thesis that semantic file systems present a more effective storage abstraction than do traditional tree structured file systems for information sharing and command level programming. },
