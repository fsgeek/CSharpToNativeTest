Reason PageRank changed the game is because it fundamentally captured
relationships.

The issue around activity context.  There's a bunch of data that says "this
helps".  There's a bunch of stuff we already collect on our systems that we
don't use.

There's potentially other things that could help.  The "cat video filter".

(Bottom line: less past stuff, more my work/contributions.)
(No cartoons, no video clips)

Whole keyboard section has nothing to do with my work.  Mood is not useful
"other than" as an example.

Claim there all these other kinds of data we _might_ want to allow, so the goal
is to build an architecture that's flexible enough.

The other thing I didn't do is giving a use case early on.  Give a very short
use case: "I was searching for airline tickets and I saw an ad I took a picture
and it is somewhere on my devices that I don't know were.  I kno..."

Spreadsheet example: "Modified it, can't find it in e-mail, screwed it up."

Here are things we still can't do today, even though the underlying assumptions
on which this is based have been known "forever".

Pull Vianna's work forward and use that to motivate the research that I propose
doing.

Undersold privacy argument.  Architecture permits me to store it locally, but
this is out-of-context for the dissertation.  "By design I'm trying to keep this
of reasonable scope."  The architecture allows me to have distributed services.

"High-order bit: less of the intro storytelling, more of the actual work and
wherever I can be more precise is a total win."

More specificity in the schedule/proposal section.

# Here are the notes from Margo's e-mail

10:10
	The cartoon is perhaps too detailed to use in a talk

10:13
	Activity context -- maybe nail this a bit more precisely
	(I wonder if a use case might be helpful in motivating AC)

Vanevar bush: I really had the term 'seminal'

I wonder if instead of focusing on decades old work -- you can just
reference hyper links as a form of association -- it's well documented
what a big deal that was

10:23 (Just got to placeless)
	We are still talking about search versus find and it seems that
	we've spent 12 minutes on a bunch of stuff that doesn't really
	have anything to do with your work -- it's still all background
	definitions, etc.

	So, this is lovely storytelling and might be fine for a longer
	talk, but I worry that the timing balance is wrong for this 30
	minute presentation.

10:24	Guo - first to really use the term AC to describe what I'm doing

	"This problem" -- it would be way more concrete with some concrete
	specific examples

	Do we really need to start with a flat namespace and explain
	the evolution from the 1960's?

10:25	Vianna's work is perfect -- you're basically trying to supply
	the data for her work - -this suggests a  great way to avoid
	doing the HCI part of your work

10:26	Keyboards?  this is totally irrelevant
	The cartoon is cute, but not a great use of time

	This whole section is a no-sequitur (it is at best 1 sentence
	that makes the case that there is a lot of rich data)

10:28 -- you are now finally coming back to AC
	This needs to happen probably around minute 5 or 6
	NO -- do not include the BofH audio click

10:29	Mood: this goes back to the keyabord issue -- it's just about other
	forms of data that people haven't considered

10:30	THIS LEADS TO MY RESEARCH PROPOSAL and you're restating your
	thesis statement

	AC: just divide it into 3 categories:
		What others have already done/used
		Stuff that we have available but don't use
		Stuff I could imagine wanting to collect

The RQs feel pretty vague here (unlike in the write up) -- they could
apply to any database project.

Privacy: I'm going to address it via offering personal namespaces -- so
I am addressing it; story here is fine, but don't undersell.

I think I want a story on 'things I've done to prepare for this'

Too vague 'some simple examples'

10:33 -- the cartoon is too wordy again

And you're still not saying anything specific about what you're
doing -- everything is vague -- building things; building data sets

It's 10:34 and it's the first time that you've told us anything concrete
that you're doing and you're doing it only by giving me names -- there is no
picture for anyone to understand what you're really talking about doing.

10:35: PICTURE JUST SHOWS UP

	This probably something that needs to appear by
	something like 10 minutes in and should drive the rest
	of the talk

	You could imagine more detailed discussions of the pieces; how
	they differ from what exists.

I found the fonts on the Topish image too small to read (on a reasonable
sized display)

You are at 10:39 and just talking (VAGUELY) about how to build Topish;
again there is nothing specific.

"It would be great if I could ..." -- I WILL BUILD datasets quickly so
that I can enable others to do things

10:40 Evaluation

Prior work has established that the data I'm proposing to collect helps,
so I'm leaving that eval to HCI folks

9 months 'beginning to build' -- that seems like a long time to not have
something very concrete. I think that 9 months is way too vague.

10:42
Skip the whole freaking latex thing.
