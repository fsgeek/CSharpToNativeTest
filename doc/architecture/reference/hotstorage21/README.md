# Naming is _Hard_

This paper is a follow-up to our rejected HotOS paper ("Silos are for grain, not
namespaces).  We have identified specific factors that the reviewers did not
like about our prior work and this is our attempt to adress those.

See [Silos
Redux](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGW2dpxqdKW8uKJg60HuIx7FydF-OTBS0O6YWt25U90/edit#gid=0)
for information about the key objections from the rejection and our discussion
about them.
