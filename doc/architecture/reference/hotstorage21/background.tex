\system draws on prior work in semantic file systems, using search to locate documents, and federated naming systems.

\noindent\textbf{Semantic File Systems.}
Although we introduced our desire for semantically meaningful names with reference to the Placeless architecture, the idea originated in the systems community with the semantic file system~\cite{giffordSFS}, SFS.
SFS used automatically extracted attributes to construct virtual directories that contained collections of semantically related documents.
There exist many extensions or variants on this theme such as per-process namespaces~\cite{plan9}, inverting the database/file system layering to build file systems on top of queriable databases~\cite{inversion}, 
manually tagged file systems~\cite{tagfs},
constructing semantic metadata stores from distributed storage~\cite{smartstore}, and systems that manage conventional and semantic structures in parallel~\cite{gfs}.
\system represents another step in this evolution.
It extends prior work by combining semantic naming with user activity context and is designed for today's multi-silo'd storage encompassing everything from mobile devices to desktops to object stores to cloud storage.

\noindent\textbf{Search.}
An alternative to creating a semantically meaningful name space is to enable extensive metadata-based search.
Desktop tools such as Appleâ€™s Spotlight, Linux KDE Baloo, and Windows
Desktop Search adopt this approach.
However, breakthroughs in web search (i.e., incorporation of pagerank~\cite{page1999pagerank}) demonstrated that the relationship among objects is at least as important as the metadata itself.
The efficacy of provenance-assisted search~\cite{provsearch,uprove2,pindex} demonstrates that history, in addition to relationships enhance users' ability to locate documents.
However, searching for documents is fundamentally different from naming.
Search-based approaches rely either on a user to select the correct item from many presented or on the sufficiency of providing \emph{any} relevant document.
However, naming requires the ability to identify a specific document. \system is designed to support both searching and uniquely identifying a specific document.

\noindent\textbf{Multi-silo Data Aggregation.}

UNIX mount points~\cite{unix} are perhaps the first instance of federating namespaces.
Distributed federation, as provided by distributed file systems such as NFS~\cite{nfs} and AFS~\cite{howard1988scale} followed soon after adoption of local area networks.
With the advent of cloud storage, there has been work in federated namespaces that span 
cloud stores~\cite{scfs,federatedMetaData}. 
Nextcloud (\url{https://nextcloud.com}) allows users to connect multiple Nextcloud instances and integrate with 
FTP, CIFS, NFS and Object stores. Yet, documents are still organized in a classic
hierarchical structure. Peer-to-peer sharing networks (e.g., IPFS \cite{benet2014ipfs}) implement a distributed 
file system where nodes advertise their files to users.
MetaStorage~\cite{metastorage} implements a highly available, distributed hash table, 
% similar to Amazon's DynamoDB, %% trying to cut a line or two to get us under the limit and if we leave this here, it needs a reference
but with 
its data replicated and distributed across different cloud providers.
% MetaStore offers a key-value store interface. 
Farsite~\cite{Adya:2003:Farsite} organizes multiple machines into virtual file servers, each of which acts as the root of a distributed file system. Comet describes a cloud oriented federated metadata service~\cite{federatedMetaData}.
