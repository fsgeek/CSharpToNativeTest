abstract = {Document properties are a compelling infrastructure on which to develop document management applications. A property-based approach avoids many of the problems of traditional heierarchical storage mechanisms, reflects document organizations meaningful to user tasks, provides a means to integrate the perspectives of multiple individuals and groups, and does this all within a uniform interaction framework. Document properties can reflect not only categorizations of documents and document use, but also expressions of desired system activity, such as sharing criteria, replication management, and versioning. Augmenting property-based document management systems with active properties that carry executable code enables the provision of document-based services on a property infrastructure. The combination of document properties as a uniform mechanism for document management, and active properties as a way of delivering document services, represents a new paradigm for document management infrastructures. The Placeless Documents system is an experimental prototype developed to explore this new paradigm. It is based on the seamless integration of user-specific, active properties. We present the fundamental design approach, explore the challenges and opportunities it presents, and show our architectures deals with them.},

abstract = {A semantic file system is an information storage system that provides flexible associative access to the system's contents by automatically extracting attributes from files with file type specific transducers. Associative access is provided by a conservative extension to existing tree-structured file system protocols, and by protocols that are designed specifically for content based access. Compatiblity with existing file system protocols is provided by introducing the concept of a virtual directory. Virtual directory names are interpreted as queries, and thus provide flexible associative access to files and directories in a manner compatible with existing software. Rapid attribute-based access to file system contents is implemented by automatic extraction and indexing of key properties of file system objects. The automatic indexing of files and directories is called "semantic" because user programmable transducers use information about the semantics of updated file system objects to extract the properties for indexing. Experimental results from a semantic file system implementation support the thesis that semantic file systems present a more effective storage abstraction than do traditional tree structured file systems for information sharing and command level programming.},

abstract = {Plan 9 is a distributed system built at the Computing Sciences Research Center of AT&T Bell Laboratories over the last few years. Its goal is to provide a production-quality system for software development and general computation using heterogeneous hardware and minimal software. A Plan 9 system comprises CPU and file servers in a central location connected together by fast networks. Slower networks fan out to workstation-class machines that serve as user terminals. Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks. The foundations of the system are built on two ideas: a per-process name space and a simple message-oriented file system protocol.},

abstract = {Organizing documents in the file system is one of the most tedious and thorny tasks for most computer users. Taxonomies based on hand made directory hierarchies still remain the only possible alternative for most small and medium enterprises, public administrations and individual users. However, both the limitations of the hierarchical organization of file systems and the difficulty of maintaining the coherence within the taxonomy have raised the need for more scalable and effective approaches.Desktop searching applications provide proprietary interfaces that enable content-based searching at the cost of having no control on the indexing and ranking of results. Semantic file systems, instead, leave users the freedom to manage the taxonomy according to their specific needs, but lose the standard file system features.In this paper we describe GFS (graph-based file system) a new hybrid file system that extends the standard hierarchical organization of files with semantic features. GFS allows the user to nest semantic spaces inside the directory hierarchy leaving unaltered system folders. Semantic spaces allow customized file tagging and leverage on browsing to guide file searching.Since GFS does not change the low-level interface to interact with file systems, users can continue to use their favorite file managers to interact with it. Moreover, no changes are required to integrate the semantic features in proprietary software.},

abstract = {As the scope of personal data grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to find what we need when we need it. Desktop search tools provide a potential answer, but most existing tools are incomplete solutions: they index content, but fail to capture dynamic relationships from the user's context. One emerging solution to this is context-enhanced search, a technique that reorders and extends the results of content-only search using contextual information. Within this framework, we propose using strict causality, rather than temporal locality, the current state of the art, to direct contextual searches. Causality more accurately identifies data flow between files, reducing the false-positives created by context-switching and background noise. Further, unlike previous work, we conduct an online user study with a fully-functioning implementation to evaluate user-perceived search quality directly. Search results generated by our causality mechanism are rated a statistically-significant 17\% higher on average over all queries than by using content-only search or context-enhanced search with temporal locality.},
