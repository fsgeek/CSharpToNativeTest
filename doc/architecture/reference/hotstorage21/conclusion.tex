\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented our position that we need \system, a storage architecture that decouples naming from the storage location of documents and data objects, provides customizable and personalized namespaces, and that makes relationships between documents a first class citizen. With \system, users will be able to organize, share and find their data conveniently across multiple storage silos using a rich set of attributes breaking away from the rigid, hierarchical organization.

We expect \system will enable a broad area of research in HCI exploring new ways to visualize and interact with data using the mechanism's provided by \system. Moreover, we expect \system to provide interesting scenarios for security and privacy research in storage systems.
