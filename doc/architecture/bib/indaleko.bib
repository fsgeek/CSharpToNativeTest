  abstract   = {Document properties are a compelling infrastructure on which to develop document management applications. A property-based approach avoids many of the problems of traditional heierarchical storage mechanisms, reflects document organizations meaningful to user tasks, provides a means to integrate the perspectives of multiple individuals and groups, and does this all within a uniform interaction framework. Document properties can reflect not only categorizations of documents and document use, but also expressions of desired system activity, such as sharing criteria, replication management, and versioning. Augmenting property-based document management systems with active properties that carry executable code enables the provision of document-based services on a property infrastructure. The combination of document properties as a uniform mechanism for document management, and active properties as a way of delivering document services, represents a new paradigm for document management infrastructures. The Placeless Documents system is an experimental prototype developed to explore this new paradigm. It is based on the seamless integration of user-specific, active properties. We present the fundamental design approach, explore the challenges and opportunities it presents, and show our architectures deals with them.},

  abstract  = {A semantic file system is an information storage system that provides flexible associative access to the system's contents by automatically extracting attributes from files with file type specific transducers. Associative access is provided by a conservative extension to existing tree-structured file system protocols, and by protocols that are designed specifically for content based access. Compatiblity with existing file system protocols is provided by introducing the concept of a virtual directory. Virtual directory names are interpreted as queries, and thus provide flexible associative access to files and directories in a manner compatible with existing software. Rapid attribute-based access to file system contents is implemented by automatic extraction and indexing of key properties of file system objects. The automatic indexing of files and directories is called "semantic" because user programmable transducers use information about the semantics of updated file system objects to extract the properties for indexing. Experimental results from a semantic file system implementation support the thesis that semantic file systems present a more effective storage abstraction than do traditional tree structured file systems for information sharing and command level programming.},

Its goal is to provide a production-quality system for software development and general computation using heterogeneous hardware and minimal software. A Plan 9 system comprises CPU and file servers in a central location connected together by fast networks. Slower networks fan out to workstation-class machines that serve as user terminals. Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks. The foundations of the system are built on two ideas: a per-process name space and a simple message-oriented file system protocol.},

  abstract  = {Organizing documents in the file system is one of the most tedious and thorny tasks for most computer users. Taxonomies based on hand made directory hierarchies still remain the only possible alternative for most small and medium enterprises, public administrations and individual users. However, both the limitations of the hierarchical organization of file systems and the difficulty of maintaining the coherence within the taxonomy have raised the need for more scalable and effective approaches.Desktop searching applications provide proprietary interfaces that enable content-based searching at the cost of having no control on the indexing and ranking of results. Semantic file systems, instead, leave users the freedom to manage the taxonomy according to their specific needs, but lose the standard file system features.In this paper we describe GFS (graph-based file system) a new hybrid file system that extends the standard hierarchical organization of files with semantic features. GFS allows the user to nest semantic spaces inside the directory hierarchy leaving unaltered system folders. Semantic spaces allow customized file tagging and leverage on browsing to guide file searching.Since GFS does not change the low-level interface to interact with file systems, users can continue to use their favorite file managers to interact with it. Moreover, no changes are required to integrate the semantic features in proprietary software.},

  abstract  = {As the scope of personal data grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to find what we need when we need it. Desktop search tools provide a potential answer, but most existing tools are incomplete solutions: they index content, but fail to capture dynamic relationships from the user's context. One emerging solution to this is context-enhanced search, a technique that reorders and extends the results of content-only search using contextual information. Within this framework, we propose using strict causality, rather than temporal locality, the current state of the art, to direct contextual searches. Causality more accurately identifies data flow between files, reducing the false-positives created by context-switching and background noise. Further, unlike previous work, we conduct an online user study with a fully-functioning implementation to evaluate user-perceived search quality directly. Search results generated by our causality mechanism are rated a statistically-significant 17\% higher on average over all queries than by using content-only search or context-enhanced search with temporal locality.},

They also function as abstract linguistic markers that signal and underscore their referents' individuality. I promote this thesis to explain why we give proper names to certain particulars, but not others; to account for the transfer of singular thought via communication with proper names; and, more generally, to support a cognitivist, not acquaintance or instrumentalist, theory of singular thought.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of mobile technologies has facilitated users to generate and store files on mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. However, it has become a challenging issue for users to efficiently and effectively search for files of interest in a mobile environment involving a large number of mobile nodes. This paper presents SemFARM framework which facilitates users to publish, annotate and retrieve files which are geographically distributed in a mobile network enabled by Bluetooth. The SemFARM framework is built on semantic web technologies in support of file retrieval on low-end mobile devices. A generic ontology is developed which defines a number of keywords, their possible domains and properties. Based on semantic reasoning, similarity degrees are computed to match user queries with published file descriptions. The SemFARM prototype is implemented using the Java mobile platform (J2ME). The performance of SemFARM is evaluated from a number of aspects in comparison with traditional mobile file systems and enhanced alternatives. Experimental results are encouraging showing the effectiveness of SemFARM in file retrieval. We can conclude that the use of semantic web technologies have facilitated file retrieval in mobile computing environments maximizing user satisfaction in searching for files of interest.},

In fact, explaining all the complexity of semantic annotation systems to laymen can sometime be difficult. We believe that this communication can be simplified by providing a meaningful abstraction of the state of the art in semantic annotation models and thus, in this article, we describe the issue of semantic annotation and review a number of research and end-user tools in the field. Doing so, we provide a clear classification scheme of the features of annotation systems. We then show how this scheme can be used to clarify requirements of end-user use cases and thus simplify the communication between semantic annotation experts and the actual users of this technology.},

  abstract = {A mechatronic system is a synergistic integration of mechanical, electrical, electronic and software technologies into electromechanical systems. Unfortunately, mechanical, electrical, and software data are often handled in separate Product Data Management (PDM) systems with no automated sharing of data between them or links between their data. Presently, this is a significant drawback with regard to supporting the collaborative and integrated design of mechatronic systems. One underlying research question to be addressed is: "How can such domain-specific PDM systems be integrated and what are the standards needed for this?" Our starting point for addressing this question is to look into how engineering data is stored today. We believe that the more intelligent and sophisticated the mechanisms for file management are, the more Computer-aided Engineering systems will benefit from them in terms of making integrated cross-disciplinary product development more efficient. However, while Computer-Aided Design and Engineering (CAD/CAE) systems and related tools such as, for example, Product Data Management (PDM), Engineering Data Management (EDM), etc. have significantly matured over the past ten years, most of their associated database systems are still based on traditional file systems and hierarchical directory structures. In light of this context, we will initially discuss a number of disadvantages of current file management systems. In the body of the paper our main contribution is presented. That is, a formal mathematical model of a new semantic file system, SIL (Semantics Instead of Location), that allows engineers to access data based on semantic information rather than storage location is proposed. A major difference between our approach and previous related work is that we do not aim at yet another point solution and, instead, propose an approach that may be employed by next generation engineering data processing systems on a larger scale. In addition, a corresponding programming interface along with a graphical user interface used as a file browser is presented and the benefits of utilizing the proposed semantic file system for product data management in the field of integrated design of mechatronic systems are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This strict adherence is kept on all levels, ranging from the identification and transportation (URI, HTTP) to the interpretation (RDF, RDFS, OWL) of resource descriptions. Because these standards are open and accessible to everybody, broad acceptance and proliferation of LOD technologies in Web-based applications and services are enabled. On typical desktops, however, the majority of applications are not aware of Web standards, but use hierarchical file systems to organize and store information. This results in a gap between the two distinct information spaces of the Web and the desktop. To bridge this gap, we propose a virtual file system representation of LOD sets, through which they can be accessed as if they were present in the file system and thus easily be used within desktop applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a Versatile Searchable File System, VSFS, which builds POSIX-compatible namespace using a novel Namespace-based File Query Language (NFQL). This enables analytics applications to utilize VSFS high-performance file-search service without changing their data model. VSFS versatile file-indexing mechanism is designed to offer great flexibility for applications to control indices to satisfy analytics needs. The evaluations driven by two real-world analytics applications demonstrate VSFS' high scalability and powerful data-filtering functionality.},

@article{Schandl2009a,
  abstract = {With the increasing storage capacity of personal computing devices, the problems of information overload and information fragmentation become apparent on users' desktops. For the Web, semantic technologies aim at solving this problem by adding a machine-interpretable information layer on top of existing resources, and it has been shown that the application of these technologies to desktop environments is helpful for end users. Certain characteristics of the Semantic Web architecture that are commonly accepted in the Web context, however, are not desirable for desktops; e.g., incomplete information, broken links, or disruption of content and annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose the sile model, an intermediate data model that combines attributes of the Semantic Web and file systems. This model is intended to be the conceptual foundation of the Semantic Desktop, and to serve as underlying infrastructure on which applications and further services, e.g., virtual file systems, can be built. In this paper, we present the sile model, discuss Semantic Web vocabularies that can be used in the context of this model to annotate desktop data, and analyze the performance of typical operations on a virtual file system implementation that is based on this model.},

@article{Min2015,
  abstract = {Today, systems software is too complex to be bug-free. To find bugs in systems software, developers often rely on code checkers, like Sparse in Linux. However, the capability of existing tools used in commodity, large-scale systems is limited to finding only shallow bugs that tend to be introduced by the simple mistakes of programmers and require no deep understanding of code. Unfortunately, a majority of and difficult-to-find bugs are semantic ones, which violate high-level rules or invariants (e.g., missing a permission check). Thus, it is difficult for code-checking tools that lack the understanding of a programmer's true intention, to reason about semantic correctness. To solve this problem, we present JUXTA, a tool that au-tomatically infers high-level semantics directly from source code. The key idea of JUXTA is to compare and contrast mul-tiple existing implementations that obey latent yet implicit high-level semantics. For example, the implementation of open() at the file system layer expects to handle an out-of-space error of the disk, regardless of implementation. We have applied JUXTA to 54 file systems in the stock Linux kernel (680K LoC), found 139 previously unknown semantic bugs (one bug per 4.9K LoC), and provided corresponding patches to 41 different file systems that include mature, popu-lar file systems like ext4, btrfs, xfs and nfs. These semantic bugs are not easy to locate, as all that JUXTA found have ex-isted for over 6.4 years on average. Not only do our empirical results look promising, but the design of JUXTA is generic (not specific to file systems) enough to be easily extended to any software that has multiple implementations, like browsers or network stacks.

  abstract = {We capture student interactions in an e-learning community to construct a semantic web (SW) to create a collective meta-knowledge structure guiding students as they search the existing knowledge corpus. We use formal concept analysis (FCA) as a knowledge acquisition tool to process the students virtual surfing trails to express and exploit the dependencies between web-pages to yield subsequent and more effective focused search results. We mirror social navigation and bypass the cumbersome manual annotation of webpages and at the same time paralleling social navigation for knowledge. We present our system KAPUST2 (Keeper and Processor of User Surfing Trails) which constructs from captured students trails a conceptual lattice guiding student queries. We use KAPUST as an e-learning software for an undergraduate class over two semesters. We show how the lattice evolved over the two semesters, improving its performance by exploring the relationship between 'kinds' of research assignments and the e-learning semantic web development. Course instructors monitored the evolution of the lattice with interesting positive pedagogical consequences. These are reported as well in this paper. ? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gifford1991,
  abstract = { A semantic file system is an information storage system that provides flexible associative access to the system's contents by automatically extracting attributes from files with file type specific transducers. Associative access is provided by a conservative extension to existing tree-structured file system protocols, and by protocols that are designed specifically for content based access. Compatiblity with existing file system protocols is provided by introducing the concept of a virtual directory. Virtual directory names are interpreted as queries, and thus provide flexible associative access to files and directories in a manner compatible with existing software. Rapid attribute-based access to file system contents is implemented by automatic extraction and indexing of key properties of file system objects. The automatic indexing of files and directories is called "semantic" because user programmable transducers use information about the semantics of updated file system objects to extract the properties for indexing. Experimental results from a semantic file system implementation support the thesis that semantic file systems present a more effective storage abstraction than do traditional tree structured file systems for information sharing and command level programming. },

As users have begun to interact with increasing amounts of data and are increasingly demanding search capability, such a simple hierarchical model has outlasted its usefulness. For this reason, we should design file systems whose organizations map to the ways we access and manipulate data now. We present a new file system architecture in which we replace the hierarchical namespace with a tagged, search-based one.},

Its goal is to provide a production-quality system for software development and general computation using heterogeneous hardware and minimal software. A Plan 9 system comprises CPU and file servers in a central location connected together by fast networks. Slower networks fan out to workstation-class machines that serve as user terminals. Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks. The foundations of the system are built on two ideas: a per-process name space and a simple message-oriented file system protocol.},

  abstract  = {A semantic file system is an information storage system that provides flexible associative access to the system's contents by automatically extracting attributes from files with file type specific transducers. Associative access is provided by a conservative extension to existing tree-structured file system protocols, and by protocols that are designed specifically for content based access. Compatiblity with existing file system protocols is provided by introducing the concept of a virtual directory. Virtual directory names are interpreted as queries, and thus provide flexible associative access to files and directories in a manner compatible with existing software. Rapid attribute-based access to file system contents is implemented by automatic extraction and indexing of key properties of file system objects. The automatic indexing of files and directories is called "semantic" because user programmable transducers use information about the semantics of updated file system objects to extract the properties for indexing. Experimental results from a semantic file system implementation support the thesis that semantic file systems present a more effective storage abstraction than do traditional tree structured file systems for information sharing and command level programming.},

  abstract = {Spatial ability has been valued as a talent domain and as an assessment form that reduces cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic status biases, yet little is known of the spatial ability of students in gifted programs compared with those in general education. Spatial ability is considered an important indicator of potential talent in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study explored undergraduate students’ spatial ability, focusing on mental rotation, by investigating the relationships of three variables with performance on a spatial ability test, in terms of test scores and test completion time. A three-way analysis of variance revealed statistically significant main effects of gifted program participation, choice of academic major, and gender, suggesting that students who participated in a gifted program, who majored in a STEM discipline, or who were male outperformed their counterparts on a measure of spatial ability when the other conditions were equivalent. No interaction effects existed among the three variables, indicating that none of them functioned as a moderator of students’ performance on the spatial ability assessment. However, when spatial ability was considered as a mediating variable in a path model, gender had the largest total effect on the probability of students majoring in a STEM area. In addition, the more time students spent on the spatial ability test, the better they tended to perform, which is a finding inconsistent with current literature.}

               from an instrumented digital photograph management tool called Shoebox. Alongside
               simple browsing features such as folders, thumbnails and timelines, Shoebox has some
               advanced multimedia features: content-based image retrieval and speech recognition
               applied to voice annotations. Our results suggest that participants found their digital
               photos much easier to manage than their non-digital ones, but that this advantage
               was almost entirely due to the simple browsing features. The advanced features were
               not used very often and their perceived utility was low. These results should help
               to inform the design of improved tools for managing personal digital photographs.},

  abstract  = {While hierarchical namespaces such as filesystems and repositories have long been
               used to organize data, the rapid increase in data production places increasing strain
               on users who wish to make use of the data. So called "data lakes" embrace the storage
               of data in its natural form, integrating and organizing in a Pay-as-you-go fashion.
               While this model defers the upfront cost of integration, the result is that data is
               unusable for discovery or analysis until it is processed. Thus, data scientists are
               forced to spend significant time and energy on mundane tasks such as data discovery,
               cleaning, integration, and management -- when this is neglected, "data lakes" become
               "data swamps."Prior work suggests that pure computational methods for resolving issues
               with the data discovery and management components are insufficient. Here, we provide
               evidence to confirm this hypothesis, showing that methods such as automated file clustering
               are unable to extract the necessary features from repositories to provide useful information
               to end-user data scientists, or make effective data management decisions on their
               behalf. We argue that the combination of frameworks for specifying file similarity
               and human-in-the-loop interaction is needed to aid automated organization. We propose
               an initial step here, classifying several dimensions by which items may be considered
               similar: the data, its origin, and its current characteristics. We initially consider
               this model in the context of identifying data that can be integrated or managed collectively.
               We additionally explore how current methods can be used to automate decision making
               using real-world data repository and file systems, and suggest how an online user
               study could be developed to further validate this hypothesis.},

However, due to dataveillance and related concerns, the magnitude and specificity of this data has given rise to well documented privacy concerns. Amongst these concerns is the unregulated collection of online metadata. Despite being commonly used, metadata is a term that few understand. Yet its richness, prevalence and collection has serious implications for many. In this paper we describe initial work with regards to a means of allowing users to control access to metadata pertaining to them, with a view to addressing these implications. To do so, we leverage the work of the Solid data decentralisation project and build upon the notion of Category-Based Access Control.},

  abstract  = {Database management system (DBMS) configuration tuning is an essential aspect of any
               data-intensive application effort. But this is historically a difficult task because
               DBMSs have hundreds of configuration "knobs" that control everything in the system,
               such as the amount of memory to use for caches and how often data is written to storage.
               The problem with these knobs is that they are not standardized (i.e., two DBMSs use
               a different name for the same knob), not independent (i.e., changing one knob can
               impact others), and not universal (i.e., what works for one application may be sub-optimal
               for another). Worse, information about the effects of the knobs typically comes only
               from (expensive) experience.To overcome these challenges, we present an automated
               approach that leverages past experience and collects new information to tune DBMS
               configurations: we use a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
               methods to (1) select the most impactful knobs, (2) map unseen database workloads
               to previous workloads from which we can transfer experience, and (3) recommend knob
               settings. We implemented our techniques in a new tool called OtterTune and tested
               it on two DBMSs. Our evaluation shows that OtterTune recommends configurations that
               are as good as or better than ones generated by existing tools or a human expert.},

  abstract  = {The POSIX shell is 'stringy', and its ecosystem primarily supports line-oriented formats.
               While such formats are popular and common, contemporary programming often involves
               semi-structured data, like JSON or YAML. Dealing with such formats, the shell's stringiness
               leaves users out in the cold---the POSIX ecosystem struggles with semi-structured
               data. New command-line tools work well with 'modern' data formats, but each tool is
               its own complex language to learn.The tree-like filesystem is the shell's only real
               data structure. By mapping 'modern' formats onto file hierarchies, we can work effectively

               associations by creating semantic links of personal desktop resources from explicit
               and implicit user activities. With these links, associations among memory fragments
               can be built or rebuilt in a user's brain during a search. The personalized ranking
               scheme uses these links together with a user's personal preferences to rank results
               by both relevance and importance. XSearcher enhances traditional keyword based search
               systems since it is closer to the way that human associative memory works.},

                local network and focuses on ways to support distributed programs that require efficient
                interprocessor communication. It is motivated by the availability of increasingly
                high speed local networks and inefficiencies in existing communication subsystems.Mechanisms
                such as remote procedure calls, monitor calls, and message passing primitives are
                bases for interprocessor communication at high levels (i.e., within a programming
                language). At lower levels, interprocessor communication occurs via the transmission
                of data over some communication medium. On a local network, this basic communication
                mechanism is the transmission of packets.This paper is concerned with an intermediate
                communication layer for high speed local networks. To provide overall efficiency,
                this layer should provide communication primitives that (1) are a good basis on which
                to implement high level primitives and (2) are specialized enough to be implemented
                efficiently; for example, in a combination of microcode and hardware.To analyze communication
                primitives for this intermediate layer, we present a communication model called the
                remote reference/remote operation model in which a taxonomy of communication primitives
                is defined. We illustrate the model by describing an implementation of simple communication
                primitives on Xerox Alto computers interconnected with a 3 megabit Ethernet.},
