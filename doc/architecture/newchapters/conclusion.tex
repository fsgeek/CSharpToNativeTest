My proposal sets out a plan to mine existing information that is available for
collection on our own computer systems in order to solve the myriad obstacles
that modern storage systems present to human users when attempting to find
specific content.

I will achieve this by creating a flexible systems infrastructure for capturing
a broad range of information about the user's interactions with the wider world
in which the user operates.  This will then allow that information to be used to
facilitate the core user objective of \emph{finding}, regardless of device,
storage location, or name.

While there is strong evidence for my thesis, it remains to be proven.  Using
the system that I develop, I will be able to defend my thesis and improve the
usefulness of computer systems to human users.
